mangel: DIY gigs around the world - in one place




One thing I found particularity frustrating when travelling
no facebook and finding myself in a new city very challenging to find
punk gigs if you don't know anyone there 


. ask a punk if you see no-one around.

mangel.info aims to be global DIY network of people submitting gigs
making it easier to find gigs for people everywhere around the in the
galaxy.

breaking free from the capitalist silos and walled garden facebook and
the like

another world is possible.
