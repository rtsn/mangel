mangel: DIY gigs around the world - in one place


One thing I found particularity frustrating when travelling
no facebook and finding myself in a new city very challenging to find
punk gigs if you don't know anyone there 

hard to *ask a punk* if you see no-one around.

mangel.domain aims to be global DIY network of people submitting gigs
making it easier to find gigs for people everywhere around the in the
galaxy.

liberate punk from the capitalist silos and walled gardens 

another world is possible.
